║     FINAL MOBILE DEBUG - WHY YOUR UI ISN'T SHOWING          ║
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

CURRENT STATUS:
===============
✓ Delta executor works on your mobile
✓ Scripts can load
✓ You see "loading" notification
✗ But the UI never appears


THE PROBLEM:
============
Your script has 19,676 lines with:
- Lines 7,526-16,056: MASSIVE UI library (8,500+ lines!)
- Lines 16,056+: UI setup for each game
- Probably hanging/failing somewhere in this UI code


TESTING PLAN - DO THESE IN ORDER:
==================================

TEST 1: GUI Creation Test
--------------------------
Upload: DRAC_GUI_TEST.lua

Loadstring:
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewmaclean2010-hash/drac.cctest/refs/heads/main/DRAC_GUI_TEST.lua"))()

WHAT THIS TESTS:
- Can your mobile Delta create GUIs at all?
- Does basic Instance.new() work?

WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN:
- 10 notifications (1-10)
- A red/black window appears with "DRAC.CC - IT WORKS!"
- You can drag it by the title bar
- Close button works

IF THIS WORKS:
→ Your executor CAN create GUIs
→ Problem is in your main script's UI library

IF THIS FAILS:
→ Your executor has issues with GUI creation
→ Need a different executor or different approach


TEST 2: Ultra Detailed Debug
-----------------------------
Upload: DRAC_ULTRA_DEBUG.lua

Loadstring:
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewmaclean2010-hash/drac.cctest/refs/heads/main/DRAC_ULTRA_DEBUG.lua"))()

WHAT THIS TESTS:
- Goes through all major sections
- Skips the complex anti-cheat code
- Skips the massive UI library
- Just tests the FLOW of your script

WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN:
- 20 notifications showing progress
- "1/20: Starting..."
- "2/20: Loading screen..."
- ... up to ...
- "20/20: COMPLETE!"

TELL ME:
Which is the LAST notification you see?
Example: "I see up to 12/20 then nothing"


WHAT'S PROBABLY HAPPENING:
===========================

Theory #1: UI Library Failing (MOST LIKELY)
--------------------------------------------
Your script has an 8,500+ line UI library.
This library probably:
- Uses functions mobile doesn't have
- Creates too many objects at once
- Has code that hangs on mobile
- Is too complex for mobile executors

SOLUTION:
- Use old script's simpler UI
- Or create a mobile-specific simplified UI


Theory #2: Anti-Cheat Hanging
------------------------------
The anti-cheat sections might be hanging because:
- getnilinstances() works differently on mobile
- getsenv() takes too long
- hookfunction() fails silently
- The infinite loops (repeat...until) hang

SOLUTION:
- Skip anti-cheat on mobile
- Or add timeouts to all repeat loops


Theory #3: Memory Issues
------------------------
Mobile devices have less RAM.
19,676 lines might be too much.

SOLUTION:
- Strip out unused game sections
- Only load code for the game you're in


WHY YOUR OLD SCRIPT WORKS:
==========================
Old script (15,986 lines):
- Simpler UI library
- Less complex anti-cheat
- Mobile-friendly code

New script (19,676 lines):
- Massive UI library (8,500 lines)
- Complex anti-cheat
- Fancy loading screens
- All causing mobile issues


NEXT STEPS:
===========

1. Run TEST 1 (DRAC_GUI_TEST.lua)
   → Tell me: Did the GUI window appear? YES/NO

2. Run TEST 2 (DRAC_ULTRA_DEBUG.lua)
   → Tell me: What's the last notification number you saw?

3. Based on results, I'll either:
   - Create a mobile-optimized UI library
   - Skip UI and use simple menus
   - Strip out the complex parts


QUICK FIX OPTION:
=================
If you just want it to WORK right now:
- Use your OLD script (the one that works)
- It has 15,986 lines and works on mobile
- Skip the new fancy features for now


ULTIMATE SOLUTION:
==================
I can create a "DRAC.CC Mobile Edition":
- Strips out PC-only features
- Simplified UI for touch screens
- No complex anti-cheat
- Optimized for mobile executors
- But I need to know which tests pass/fail first!
